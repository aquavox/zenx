Welcome to the partially open-source backend code of Zenx.ink — a privacy-first, non-custodial cryptocurrency swap platform focused on absolute user anonymity and security.

## About Zenx.ink

Zenx.ink enables fast, private, and secure swaps across multiple cryptocurrencies without logging, storing, or tracking any user data. We are committed to **zero data retention** and **full user sovereignty**.

## Why Partial Open Source?

Transparency builds trust. We provide public access to key backend components so users can verify there is **no hidden logging, tracking, or data collection**.

However, the core unique business logic, proprietary algorithms, and integrations are kept closed-source to protect Zenx.ink’s competitive edge and prevent unauthorized copying or cloning.
